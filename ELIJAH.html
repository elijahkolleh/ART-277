               <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
                <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simple dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry Loren Ipsum
                has been the  industry standerd dummy text ever since the 1500s,when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                scrambled it to make a type specimen book.It has survived not only five centuries,but also the leap into                                                                                                                                                                                                                
                electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
                Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
                <u><strong><i>Aldus PageMaker</i></strong></u> including versions of <u>Lorem Ipsum.</u> 1914 by H. Rackham
                <!--this is a translated version of the above text. I used blockquote to indent-->
                <blockquote>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore<br/>
                et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nosrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi<br/>
                ut aliquip ex ca commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse<br/>
                cillum dollore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa<br/>
                qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. </blockquote>
                <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content if a page when looking at its
                layout. The point of using <u>Lorem Ipsum</u> is that it has a more-or less normal distribution of letters, as apposed to
                using <q>Content here, content here</q>, making it look readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and
                web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as  their default model text, and a search for "lorem Ipsum" will uncover
                many web sites still in their infancy.Various version have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident
                sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
<h3>Where can I get some?</h3>
<strong>There are many variation of passages of Lorem Ipsum availabe, but the majority have suffered
alteration in some from, by injected humous, or <u>randomized words</u> which don't look even slighty
believable.</strong> If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything
embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.<i> All the Lorem Ipsum, generator on the Internet tend to repeat
predefined chunks as neccessary, making this the first true generator on the internet.</i> It uses a dictionary of over
200 Latin words, combined Lorem Isum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-
characteristic words etc.
